# MultipartErb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/econsultancy/multiparterb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/econsultancy/multiparterb) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/multiparterb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/multiparterb)

**MultipartErb** allows you to render multipart e-mails from a single template.

The template is written in HTML with a reduced set of HTML elements,
which is then parsed and formatted through user provided formatters,
which then renders and delivers as both text and HTML parts.

## Installation

Add it into your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'multiparterb'
```

Install it

```console
bundle install
```

## Usage

### Templates

You create one erb template file written in HTML with a reduced set of elements.

Example `app/views/notifier/contact.multipart` :

```erb
<h1>Heading with a link to <a href="https://example.com">Example</a></h1>
<p>body with a link to <a href="https://econsultancy.com">Econsultancy</a></p>
<a href="http://example.com">a link with a <h1>heading</h1> in</a>
```

### Formatters

You then have to create and provide one or more formatters for MultipartErb to call on each element it finds.

This is derived from a base class `BaseFormatter` provided by MultipartErb, any undefined methods that get called will raise a `NotImplementedError`.

This example formats the elements as it finds them, standard HTML output. _(TODO: Maybe provide this as standard?)_

```ruby
class MyHTMLFormatter < MultipartErb::BaseFormatter
  def heading(text)
    content_tag(:h1, text)
  end

  def paragraph(text)
    content_tag(:p, text)
  end

  def anchor(text, href)
    content_tag(:a, text, href: href)
  end
end
```

And here is an example text formatter.

```ruby
class MyTextFormatter < MultipartErb::BaseFormatter
  def heading(text)
    "*** #{text} ***\n"
  end

  def paragraph(text)
    text
  end

  def anchor(text, href)
    text + ' (' + href + ')'
  end
end
```

Then you need to tell MultipartErb which formatters you want it to use.

```ruby
# ./config/initializers/multiparterb.rb
MultipartErb.html_formatter = MyHTMLFormatter.new
MultipartErb.text_formatter = MyTextFormatter.new
```

It will then call the relevent method for each element it finds in the template.

### List of supported HTML tags

The set of elements this currently supports, and the method that will get called are :

* `<h1>text</h1>` => `Formatter#heading(text)`
* `<p>text</p>` => `Formatter#paragraph(text)`
* `<a href="https://example.com">text</a>` => `Formatter#anchor(text, href)`
* `<ul>text</ul>` => `Formatter#unordered_list(text)`
* `<li>text</li>` => `Formatter#list_item(text)`
* `<strong>text</strong>` => `Formatter#strong(text)`

### Mailers

Then your mailers work as normal, and you still get control over which parts you want generated :

```ruby
class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  def contact(recipient)
    @recipient = recipient
    mail(:to => @recipient, :from => "john.doe@example.com") do |format|
      format.text
      format.html
    end
  end
end
```

It will generate two parts, one in text and another in html when delivered.

If you only wanted to text or html part, then just remove the `format` you don't want.

### Output

For the above given example, the resulted output would be as such :

Text version

```
*** Heading with a link to Econsultancy (https://econsultancy.com) ***
body with a link to Econsultancy (https://econsultancy.com)
a link with a *** heading *** in (http://example.com)"
```

Html version

```
<h1>Heading with a link to <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com\">Econsultancy</a></h1>
<p>body with a link to <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com\">Econsultancy</a></p>
<a href=\"http://example.com\">a link with a <h1>heading</h1> in</a>
```

## Notes

* The `contact.multipart` template should not have a format in its name. Adding a format would make it unavailable to be rendered in different formats;

* You can use ERb inside the template, which gets parsed before the formatting occurs.
